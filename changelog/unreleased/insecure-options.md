Enhancement: Make insecure options configurable

We had several hard-coded 'insecure' flags. These options are now configurable. In development environments using self signed certs (the default) you need to set these flags:

```
STORAGE_HOME_DATAPROVIDER_INSECURE=true
STORAGE_METADATA_DATAPROVIDER_INSECURE=true
STORAGE_FRONTEND_OCDAV_INSECURE=true
STORAGE_FRONTEND_ARCHIVER_INSECURE=true
STORAGE_FRONTEND_APPPROVIDER_INSECURE=true
```
