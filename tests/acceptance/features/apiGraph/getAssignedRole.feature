Feature: assign role
  As an admin,
  I want to assign roles to users.
  So that users without an admin role cannot get the list of roles, assignments list and assign roles to users

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files


  Scenario Outline: get assigned role of a user
    Given the administrator has assigned the role "<user-role>" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    When the administrator retrieves the assigned role of user "Alice" using the Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the Graph API response should have the role "<user-role>"
    Examples:
      | user-role   |
      | Admin       |
      | Space Admin |
      | User        |
      | User Light  |

  Scenario Outline: get assigned role of a user via setting api
    Given the administrator has assigned the role "<user-role>" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    When user "Alice" tries to get list of assignment
    Then the HTTP status code should be "<http-status-code>"
    And the setting API response should have the role "<user-role>"
    Examples:
      | user-role   | http-status-code |
      | Admin       | 201              |
      | Space Admin | 401              |
      | User        | 401              |
      | User Light  | 401              |

    Given user "Brian" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    When user "Alice" tries to get the assigned role of user "Brian" using the Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "403"


  Scenario: non-admin user tries to get assigned role of nonexistent user
    Given user "Brian" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    When user "Alice" tries to get the assigned role of user "nonexistent" using the Graph API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
