Feature: backup consistency
  As a user
  I want to check my data for inconsistencies
  So that I can backup my data


  Scenario: check backup consistency via CLI command
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
      | Carol    |
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/uploadFolder"
    And user "Carol" has created folder "/uploadFolder"
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | uploadFolder |
      | space           | Personal     |
      | sharee          | Brian        |
      | shareType       | user         |
      | permissionsRole | Editor       |
    And user "Carol" has deleted file "/uploadFolder"
    And the administrator has stopped the server
    When the administrator checks the backup consistency using the CLI
    Then the command should be successful
    And the command output should contain "ðŸ’š No inconsistency found. The backup in '%storage_path%' seems to be valid."
